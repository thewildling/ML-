# Comparison of KNN to ResNet50 for pneumonia detection in X-rays:floppy_disk:

This project looks at comparing the machine learning methods Residual Neural Network (ResNet50) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for classifying real patient X-rays of pneumonia.

**Structure**

## Getting Started :checkered_flag:

To get started, download this repo either by cloning it from your IDE, or download it as a zip. 
The majority of methods can be found in ML.py and KNN_classifier.py.

The images used for training, should be put in the respective folders described in the readme-files found in the data folders.

## Running the system :rocket:

Both of the main py-files contain a main method at the bottom of the files, and can be run as is. 

## Methods :star:

methods from ML.py and KNN_classifier.py

ML.py:

### make_pred(Learner learn, string file):
Make predictions on a single image.

### make_and_train():
Creates the data used for the model. Then creates the model for the ResNet50, and trains it for 2-4-20-10 epochs. To save the model, uncomment the learn.save() line.

### interp():
creates a confusion matrix for the learner.

### load_model():
takes in the saved model from the folder specified in the train method, and loads it back, to be used without re-training. 

KNN_classifier.py:

### dataset():
Takes the images from the x-ray folder, and creates test, train and validation sets to be used for the model. 

### save_model(Trainer classifier):
saves the model to be used later.

### load_model():
loads the model saved by the save_model method to be used for classifyinfg 

### plot_best_K():
plots a graph showing what the best K-value is for the model.
